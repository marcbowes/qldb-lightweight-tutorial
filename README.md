## Setup

I am not providing explicit details here because this information is readily available online.

You will need to:

- setup JDK >= 8 and Gradle
- setup an AWS account
- setup the AWS CDK

After that, ensure that your shell environment is setup for your AWS account (and region).

## Tutorial

First change to the `cdk/` folder and then run `cdk deploy`. That will setup the resources you need. Later, you can delete them with `cdk destroy`.
